Start your first agent team
After enabling agent teams, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and the team structure you want in natural language. 
Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt.
This example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other:
--prompts--
I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across
their codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one
teammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.
-----


Create a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.
Use Sonnet for each teammate.

Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.

Create an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:
- One focused on security implications
- One checking performance impact
- One validating test coverage
Have them each review and report findings.

Users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.
Spawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to
each other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific
debate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.


Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication module
at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session
management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."

I'm designing a tool on a niche market and earn passive money. Create an agent team to explore brainstorm idears from different angles: one
teammate on generate ideas, one on review on market business predental, one on technical implementation and architecture  , one playing devil's advocate.

哇哦，Claude 的 Agent Team 真的太猛了！一个小时就把原本 geek 味十足的命令行工具，改造成浏览器里点点就能用的网页版，简直像开了挂😂。

我一直想把我发微信公众号“零代码”发布工具完成，现在终于具备了雏形 ，核心功能如下：
✅AI 写作（产品文/技术文）+封面+信息图生成  
✅Markdown 编辑 + 实时预览 + 3套主题切换（科技/简约/商务）  
✅配置 appid/appsecret 后，一键推到公众号草稿箱  

不过还没完全开源，因为生图功能（封面&信息图）还没配密钥。等密钥搞定就彻底解放了！

最爽的是整个过程我几乎没写几行代码，全靠 Claude 的 Agent Team 并行干活：
✅PM Agent 定需求  
✅前端+设计师 Agent 搭界面  
✅后端 Agent 搞微信集成  
✅Tech Writer 优化提示词  
✅QA Agent 狂测 bug……

我录了个演示视频，展示从零配置 Agent Team，到工具跑通的全过程。视频里能看到界面操作，超级直观！

谁想要使用工具的，可以直接回“+1”或“想要”，奶爸到时候加班肝出来分享给大家使用～🚀
